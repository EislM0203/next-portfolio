### About the Company
Dynatrace is a software intelligence platform designed to help organizations monitor, optimize, and manage the performance of their applications, infrastructure, and digital experiences.

### Summer Internship
During my internship at Dynatrace Austria in the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to contribute to the development of an extensible and user-friendly end-to-end test builder structure written in Java. This solution significantly reduced the time required for engineers to write tests, resulting in improved efficiency and productivity across the team. Since this was my first time working with Dynatrace, I was taken aback by how friendly the work culture there is. I was also fortunate enough to work with a great team and I was instantly a part of their social circle.
