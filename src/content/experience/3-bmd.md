### About the Company
BMD Systemhaus GesmbH was founded in 1972 and develops first-class business software for companies, tax consultants, auditors and other business areas, such as the construction industry, food production or retail and wholesale.

### Summer Internship
During my software engineering internship at BMD in 2021, I had the opportunity to work with a team on developing a knowledge sharing and idea collection platform with an Angular frontend, a PHP Backend and MongoDB as a datastore. This platform allowed both customers and internal users to share their ideas, which were then stored in an internal datastore. We implemented a workflow that enabled the appropriate stakeholders to review and approve these ideas directly within the platform. Working in the Future Lab at BMD was an invaluable experience that provided me with valuable insights into software development processes and collaboration within a professional environment.
