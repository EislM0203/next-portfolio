### Summer Internship

In the summer of 2019, I interned at Greiner Bio-One in Kremsmünster in the Controlling department. I was part of a team working on an international tax report, where I gained valuable experience in Excel Macros and the SAP ERP system they use. Overall, it was an interesting time at a great company.
