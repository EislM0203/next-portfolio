### About the Company
Dynatrace is a software intelligence platform designed to help organizations monitor, optimize, and manage the performance of their applications, infrastructure, and digital experiences.

### Writing my master thesis with Dynatrace
I joined Dynatrace on a part-time basis in January 2023 to write my master's thesis titled "Improving the search for monitoring tools using recommender technology". The details of my thesis are bound by confidentiality constraints and hence cannot be shared at this time. This restriction will lapse after a period of five years, at which point I intend to make the work publicly available on this site.

### Transitioning into a full time role
In July, I transitioned to the Systems Engineering Team, where I have had the opportunity to work with a wide range of technologies, including various programming languages, Docker, Kubernetes, and OpenTelemetry. Since January 2024, I have been an Agile Advocate in addition to being a Software Engineer. Additional resposibilities include moderating agile meetings such as Retrospectives and optimizing processes in and around the team. Moreover, I have been contributing to the OpenTelemetry demo project as part of my employment (see [Projects](/projects/3-opentelemetry-contrib)).

I thoroughly enjoy working at Dynatrace and feel fortunate to be part of such a great team.
