### About the Company
BMD Systemhaus GesmbH was founded in 1972 and develops first-class business software for companies, tax consultants, auditors and other business areas, such as the construction industry, food production or retail and wholesale.

### Summer Internship
During my software engineering internship at BMD in 2020, I worked on utilizing the speech-to-text API of Google to enable end users to create different system entries using their voice. This feature could greatly increase the efficiency of users working in the field. The internship involved developing a working Proof of Concept (PoC), which was then further refined.
