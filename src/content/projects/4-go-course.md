### Project Overview
A **REST API** for managing events and user registrations implemented while doing a golang udemy course, featuring:
- **User Management**: Create, and delete users.
- **Event Management**: Create, update, and delete events.
- **Registration**: Register and unregister users from events.
- **Authentication**: Endpoints secured with **JWT-based authentication**.
- **Database Integration**: Persistent storage for users and events with relational database support.

### Why do I like go?
Go stands out because of its **elegant simplicity**. It combines high-level convenience with low-level control, making it feel versatile and approachable. Here's what makes it special:

- **Elegant and Efficient**: Like Java, it handles a lot for you — garbage collection, type safety — but still gives you access to **pointers** for fine-tuned memory efficiency.
- **Effortless Build Process**: Building a binary is incredibly **"easy"** and straightforward, making deployment seamless.
- **Flexible Linking**: You can choose between **dynamically library linking** for efficient binaries or **statica library linking** for a totally independant binary, depending on your needs.
- **Powerful Concurrency**: With **channels** and **goroutines**, Go makes concurrent programming intuitive and scalable.

Go is a rare combination of simplicity, power, and practicality, which makes it a joy to work with.
