### Project overview
The project is an extensible and reusable personal portfolio website built using NextJS and TailwindCSS. The content is stored in markdown files, making editing and repurposing the website easy. The website is hosted on my own Kubernetes cluster (see [home cluster](/projects/2-home-cluster)). The foundation of this website was built while taking a NextJS Udemy course. I have subsequently spent a significant amount of time revamping, extending, and improving it. This project serves as a fun side project that showcases my frontend skills and presents me as a person to those who are interested.
