### Overview
In the scope of my employment with Dynatrace (see [here](/experience/1-dynatrace)) I have had the awesome opportunity to give something back to the OpenSource Community by contributing to the OpenTelemetry demo application.

### About OpenTelemetry
OpenTelemetry is a Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project that is the result of a merger between two prior projects, OpenTracing and OpenCensus. Both of these projects were created to solve the same problem: the lack of a standard for how to instrument code and send telemetry data to an Observability backend.

### What did I do?
With OpenTelemetry being an observability tool, the demo application features multiple problem patterns. I contributed by adding various feature flags, such as garbage collector and high CPU load problems using Java, connectivity issues using Go, payment failures using JavaScript and Kafka queue problems using Kotlin. Being a part of this awesome project has been a thoroughly enjoyable experience, and the community is fantastic as well.
