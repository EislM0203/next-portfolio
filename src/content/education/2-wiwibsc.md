### Study Focus
From 2018 to 2021, I pursued a degree in Business & Economics with a focus on Finance, Digital Business Management and Business Informatics at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU) in Linz. 

#### Finance
During my studies, I delved into the field of finance, gaining a deep understanding of financial principles and practices. This module covered a range of topics including financial analysis, investment strategies, risk management, and corporate finance. I developed skills in financial forecasting, budgeting, and financial decision-making, which are crucial in managing the financial health of any organization.

#### Digital Business Management
I had the chance to explore the field of digital business management during my studies. This module provided comprehensive knowledge on managing a digital business, including topics such as writing business plans, conducting analytics with SQL, and utilizing LibreOffice for tasks like writing macros. The practical application of these skills enhanced my understanding and prepared me for real-world challenges in the digital business landscape.

#### Business Informatics
During my studies, I had the opportunity to explore the field of business informatics and computer science. This module provided an introduction to the business aspects of software and allowed me to develop my coding skills in Java, which ignited my passion for software engineering. Additionally, I took courses on algorithms and data structures while also gaining a solid foundation in data and knowledge engineering.

### Bachelor Thesis
### Bachelor Thesis: Social Engineering Prevention

In my Bachelor Thesis, titled "Social Engineering Prevention - Konzeption einer Best Practice Lösung mittels Expertenbefragung", I delved into the topic of social engineering on a conceptual level and explored various defenses against it. To provide a comprehensive analysis and a best practice solution, I conducted interviews with experts in the field.

### Overall Experience
My academic journey was a rewarding and enjoyable experience. I faced challenges during my first two semesters as I completed my civil service simultaneously. However, the freedom to choose courses aligned with my interests, the camaraderie among my colleagues, and the vibrant atmosphere of the JKU campus made my time at the university truly memorable.
