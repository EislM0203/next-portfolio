### Study Focus
From 2021 to 2023, I pursued a degree in Business Informatics with a focus on Data & Knowledge Engineering, Service Engineering and Computer Science at the Johannes Kepler University (JKU) in Linz. I graduated with distinction in the summer of 2023.

#### Business Intelligence
In the Business Intelligence module, I gained extensive knowledge about Database Management Systems (DBMS), relational databases, Data Warehousing, and Semantic AI. The latter included technologies such as SPARQL, RDF, RDFS, SHACL, among others. This module equipped me with the skills to work with various data stores at conceptual, logical, and physical levels.

#### Service Engineering
The Service Engineering module was centered around service-based architectures, including distributed systems and microservices. It also covered cloud-native technologies and other service-related topics. This module provided me with invaluable skills in designing and developing full-stack distributed systems.

#### Additional Courses
In addition to my core modules, I pursued further specialization in Computer Science by taking courses in IT-Security, Secure Coding, Data Analysis, and Recommender Systems. These courses equipped me with essential skills to work efficiently and securely as a software engineer.

In addition to these technical modules, I also enrolled in courses in Information Engineering and Business Engineering. These courses were less technical and more oriented towards the business aspects of software products. They covered topics like Business Process Modelling, Knowledge Management, and Business Plan development.

### Master's Thesis
I completed my Master’s thesis titled “Improving the Search for Monitoring Tools Using Recommender Technology” in cooperation with the company Dynatrace ([see Experience](/experience/1-dynatrace)). However, due to confidentiality constraints, I am unable to share the details of my thesis at this time. These restrictions will be lifted after a period of five years, at which point I plan to make my work publicly available on this site.

### Overall Experience
Overall, my academic journey was an enriching and enjoyable experience. The freedom to choose courses that aligned with my interests, the camaraderie among my colleagues, and the vibrant atmosphere of the JKU campus made my time at the university truly memorable.
